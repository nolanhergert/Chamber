# Chamber

Testing chamber for electronics. Will test thermal, moisture, and salt too! Set up to be super basic, serial output, no fanciness needed.

## Inputs
  * Some DS18B20 temperature sensors to keep things in a good zone.

## Outputs
  * Relay board, which controls...
  * Immersion heater
  * Ultrasonic fogger / mister / atomizer. Needed to get the salt solution airborne.
  * External fan, USB powered but microcontroller controlled.
